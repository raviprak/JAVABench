/**
 * This benchmark tests how frequently a method can be called, were there no locking involved.
 *
 * This is very similar to the first sample in JMH, except that it calls a second method. This is
 * done so that it can be similar to the IntrinsicLocking benchmark
 *
 * By default:
 * 1. This test spawns as many threads as there are cores in the test environment.
 * 2. Higher numbers mean better performance.
